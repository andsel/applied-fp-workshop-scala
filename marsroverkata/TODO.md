# Enanched Mars Rover Kata

Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet.
Implement an application that simulates the movement of a rover on a planet.

NOTE: for each version: first model all functions signatures (use ??? marker) and then implement them.
      The idea is to get a quick and cheap responsibility distribution phase.

## V1 - Focus on the center (pure domain logic and types)
Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are executed by the rover.
- The planet is divided into a grid with x (width) and y (height) size.
- The rover has a position expressed as x, y co-ordinates and an orientation (North, Est, West, South).
- The rover can handle four commands: TurnLeft, TurnRight, MoveForward, MoveBackward.
- Commands are sent in batch (like an array)
- Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another (pacman effect).

## V2 - Focus on boundaries (from primitive types to domain types)
Our domain is composed by rich types but input/output data must be privitive
- Write a parser for the planet (grid) size: "5x4"
- Write a rover initial state parser: "1,3:W"
- Write an rendering as string: "positionX:positionY:direction"

## V3 - More domain logic (partial function in domain logic)
We discover that there are are obstacles on the planet.
- domain logic:
    - An obstacle has a position expressed as x, y co-ordinates.
    - There are many obstacles.
    - Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new position. 
    - If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and aborts the sequence.
- boundaries:
    - Write a parser for a list of obstacles.
    - Update rendering, show hit obstacle info.

## V4 - Focus on I/O (compose pure IO values)
Extend the "pure" way of work also to the infrastructural layer
- Build initial state and execute all commands:
    - Read and parse the planet.txt file
    - Read and parse the obstacles.txt file
    - Read and parse the rover.txt file
    - Read and parse the commands.txt file
- After commands execution:
    - Print final output to the console (happy and not happy paths)
    - Handle, in a safe way, any unhandled exception and log them
